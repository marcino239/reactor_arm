issues:

1. joints shake due to too small ineratia and too small mass:
2. shoulder_pitch joint doesn't move - check the limits

solutions for 1:
change inertia matrix:

      <inertia
	  ixx="1.0" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0"
	  iyy="1.0" iyz="0.0"
	  izz="1.0"/>
    </inertial>

change mass to:
      <mass value="0.1" />

alternatively change time step to increase precision
